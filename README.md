# My portfolio

As soon as I learned that one can host their own website on GitHub, I decided to go for it. This is the result of my incursion into that territory.

I am always up for adventure, hence I decided to create something slightly more sophisticated than a plain html+css site. GitHub itself recommends _Jekyll_, a static webpage compositor, which is integrated in GitHub Pages. I decided to give it a try, it didn't seem that complicated.

The headaches came with the theming part: after researching a bit, I found a theme which I found appealing, _Hyde_ (or, rather, its _Hydeout_ version), available in [this repository](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout). In the end I managed to subjugate it and damn, does it seem cool.
