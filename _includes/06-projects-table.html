                    I decided to put into practice what I learnt after some Deep Learning courses, specifically in regards to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells. I trained an RNN with a huge list of musician names in order for it to generate more, letter by letter.

                    For a while now I have been interested in the blockchain, and I acquired a bunch of cryptocurrencies (small amounts, I am not rich yet). In order to keep track of them, I created a simple Python script querying a local database to fetch the cryptocoins to then convert them to their euro value.

                    Some time ago I planned starting a podcast, and I enjoyed the idea of designing a script for podcasters, which would translate audio waves to different possible images or gifs, each with a unique style, out of the waves themselves or their frequency spectra.

                    During my first job as a programmer at the UAM's cluster, I was requested to develop a utility which automatically wrote a spreadsheet with information about all servers in the cluster, parsed from the email files received with the Thunderbird email client.
