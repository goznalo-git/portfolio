I will satisfy your curiosity, by either of two means: if you are interested in a broad overview of my academic and professional career, you can simply download my CV from the links below, otherwise I have prepared a detailed, chronological version of my resume. 


**In a nutshell**: A physicist with a master in High Energy Physics and String Theory, who left academia for a couple of years to gain professional experience in coding and data science, to then make a scientific comeback enrolling a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics. I guess another way to put it is the scientific version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey">the monomyth</a>.
