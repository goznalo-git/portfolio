## Current research  


I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics, in Complex Networks in particular. As such, I am obviously interested in anything related to Graph Theory and Linear Algebra, as well as computer simulations involving graphs (e.g. percolation phenomena). However, Complex Networks is an interdisciplinary field, borrowing ideas from Maths, Physics, Biology, Sociology, Computer Science, etc, so it is quite natural for me finding thought-provoking ideas in unexpected places.

However, within the realm of Complex Networks the focus of my thesis is a bit more specific: understanding the properties and applicability of centrality measures, and perhaps coming up with novel ones, solving problems in those already existing. Centrality measures are actually really interesting: they allow us to rank the nodes of a network based on different definitions of importance. This might seem unrelated to the real world, but they are more influential in our day-to-day life than we think: the Google search engine ranks results based on one of these measures, and its success is what made it the huge company it is nowadays. Part of our research revolves around understanding the behavior of this, so called, PageRank centrality measure.

### Complex Systems and Non-linear Dynamics 

Complex Systems are systems where the sum is greater than the parts, in the sense that there is some "global behavior" which can't be infered from the local dynamics. A classic example of this is flocks of birds: the individual movement of a bird does not directly affect the movement of the flock (in fact, if a bird dies there is no significant change in the flock behavior). This is completely different from, say, a machine: if a gear fails the outcome will be, at best, deteriorated. 

Complex Networks are another example of Complex Systems; there are many structural properties arising from the collective structure (topology) of the network, such as certain centralities or connectivity. And we can also discover complexity in dynamical systems built on top of networks, such as collections of oscillators whose interactions follow the graph's edges.

Besides networks, there are many systems whose dynamics are governed by non-linear differential equations (which I have always found fascinating), giving rise to interesting phenomena such as oscillations and chaos.

### (Theoretical) Physics

One does not forget its beginnings. I still enjoy reading about General Relativity (black holes, inflation, etc) and String Theory (in particular, about the AdS/CFT correspondence). But I have mixed feelings about them, and I doubt I'll ever go back.
