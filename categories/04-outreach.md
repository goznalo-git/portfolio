> _"We live in a society exquisitely dependent on science and technology, in which hardly anyone knows anything about science and technology."_ - Carl Sagan

I am a firm believer that scientific outreach is of the uttermost importance, both for researchers (as their contributions can be highlighted and made public) and for the general public (as there is an ever-growing demand for scientific talks, conferences and events bridging the gap between science and society). I have taken part in activities related to it every time I have had the chance, and I still do. Here is a summary of them.

## Outreach groups I have been part of

- <strong>ASAAF</strong> (<em>2014-2020</em>): this amateur astronomer association (_ASociación de Astrónomos AFicionados_) within the UCM is very active when it comes to organizing outreach activities. I belonged to several organizing committees, helping plan activities such as astronomical sightings, series of scientific talks, etc. Thanks to the association I met incredible people, all as passionate about science as me.
- <strong>Noether</strong> (<em>2014-2020</em>): while technically belonging to ASAAF, this was a Theoretical Physics-focused subgroup. We organized activities such as programming (Mathematica, Python, LaTeX) workshops and a yearly conference cycle, named after Emmy Noether.
- <strong>Pint of Science NL</strong> (<em>2018-2019</em>): during my stay in the Netherlands I reached out to the Pint of Science Netherlands organization (a non-profit organization known for organizing outreach talks at bars), to help organize the 2019 activies. It was a nice experience, and I even had the opportunity to host an evening on antibiotic resistance, presenting the speakers and organizing quizzes in between.

Besides organizing talks, I sometimes gave them myself. Here is a list of them.
