Science and I crossed paths early in my life. My grandma had a lung-related illness, hence I decided to be a doctor, to cure her. I was around 5, and began to read books and watch films about the human body. In secondary school, however, science became secondary in my life. Or rather, I didn't give it much though. In fact, my grandma had already left us years prior, and I began to understand I did not really like all that medical stuff after all. To this day, I feel dizzy when I see guts and organs in movies.

I reconnected with science thanks to outreach. Actually, thanks to Morgan Freeman. Yeah, for real. The year before university I was thinking of following biochemistry or a related subject, when I came across a documentary series on TV. This series had each chapter devoted to a "mistery" of the Universe (black holes, the early universe, strings and particles, etc), and was hosted by the one and only Morgan Freeman. I found it far superior than other documentaries I had previously seen (even Hawking's ones), and pushed me to study a bachelor in Physics.

From that moment on, I fell more and more in love with science, Physics and Maths in particular. And it was not only because of the courses studied during my undergrad, it was also due to the books I read, the talks I went to, the youtube channels I started following. Outreach. 

I thus consider outreach of the uttermost importance. I have taken part in activities related to it every time I have had the chance, and I still do. Here is a summary of them.


## Outreach groups I have been part of

- ASAAF (2014-2019): this amateur astronomer association (_ASociación de Astrónomos AFicionados_) within the UCM is very active when it comes to organizing outreach activities. I belonged to several organizing committees, helping plan activities such as astronomical sightings, series of scientific talks, etc. Thanks to the association I met incredible people, all as passionate about science as me.
- Noether (2014-2019): while technically an part of ASAAF, this was a Theoretical Physics-focused subgroup. We organized activities such as programming (Mathematica, Python, LaTeX) workshops and a yearly conference cycle, named after Emmy Noether.
- Pint of Science NL (2018-2019): during my stay in the Netherlands I reached out to the Pint of Science Netherlands organization (a non-profit organization known for organizing outreach talks at bars), to help organize the 2019 activies. It was a nice experience, and I even had the opportunity to host an evening on antibiotic resistance, presenting the speakers and organizing quizzes in between.

## Talks I have given

Besides organizing talks, I sometimes gave them myself. Here is a list of them.
